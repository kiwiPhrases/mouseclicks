# Mouse Clicks
A quick little Python program to click the mouse for a given time interval, somewhat randomly around the center of the screen at somewhat random time intervals. 

Tested only on Windows.

Things that need to be done:

- Package it properly as a Python package to make it pip installable
- Replace use of numpy with something simpler
